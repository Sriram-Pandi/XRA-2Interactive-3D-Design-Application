## Overview
XR App 2 expands upon the foundation of XR App 1, transforming it into an immersive 3D design experience. The application introduces a sophisticated wrist menu system, enhanced user interactions, and refined visual feedback, offering a seamless and intuitive design environment.

## Features
- **3D Wrist Menu**: A floating, rotatable menu that enables shape selection, color application, and scene reset functionality.
- **Interactive Object Manipulation**:
  - **Highlighting**: Objects change color to match the pointer when hovered.
  - **Color Application**: Objects adopt the pointer’s active color upon selection.
  - **Cloning**: Users can duplicate objects while maintaining their current properties.
  - **Destruction**: Objects can be removed with visual and audio effects.
  - **Resizing**: Objects can be dynamically scaled up or down using joystick input.
- **Haptic & Audio Feedback**:
  - Subtle vibrations for hover interactions.
  - Stronger feedback when selecting and manipulating objects.
  - Sound effects for object collisions and destruction.
- **Locomotion**:
  - Users navigate via real-world movement.
  - No artificial locomotion for improved immersion.

## Technologies Used
- **Unity** (Development Environment)
- **C#** (Programming Language)
- **Meta Quest 2** (Hardware)
- **XR Interaction Toolkit** (Interaction framework)

## Results
This application delivers an intuitive and polished 3D design experience, enabling users to visualize, modify, and interact with virtual objects dynamically. With enhanced UI and mechanics, XR App 2 provides an engaging platform for creative exploration.
